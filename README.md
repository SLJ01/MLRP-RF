# MLRP-RF
<font size="1" color=red> MLRP-RF </font> is a control reponse predictor with multi-level structure tailored for the given control chronicles. <br>
In process industries, the control variables with multiple working levels are common but complex,to address the challenging the MLRP-RF is prospoed with the attempt to provide a possibility for a multiple response prediction for process industries with model predictive control
<br><br>

The model is divided into two parts: training and prediction. The model training integrates all possible five control chronicles. The offline model examples of the five models have been provided in the warehouse. The model prediction part (**MLRP-RF predicting.py**) will be based on the trained model. The offline model makes response predictions.
